## General rules

All pricing is determined on case-by-case basis. Most tests are priced at €20 - €200 depending on test complexity and number of samples. The more services are ordered, the lower the price of each will be; this is deliberately done for three reasons:

* This makes beer better
* This is easier for us
* Commercially, everyone benefits from more tests

The analysis costs will include transportation. Again, we will strive to reduce these costs if many samples are repeatedly ordered from the same area, probably even open a new lab or send you a laboratory in a truck.
